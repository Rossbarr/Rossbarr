Hello, Iâ€™m Barrett Ross or @Rossbarr (he/his/him).

I've been programming since 2018. I started in college at Michigan State University. I first used Python to create physics models for my classes or analyze data for research. 

I graduated in 2020 with a BS, majoring in Physics and Astrophysics. Since then, I've been interested in all things programming. I have projects in Data Science, Web Dev, Game Dev, and AI.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby-on-Rails and Javascript for Web Development and C# with Unity for Game Development.
- ðŸ“« Reach me here on Github or through email at BarrettRoss23@gmail.com

My profile picture is my dog, Mr. Boogers.
