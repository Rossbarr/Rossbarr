Hello, Iâ€™m Barrett Ross or @Rossbarr (he/his/him).

I've been programming since 2018. I started in college at Michigan State University. I first used Python to create physics models for my classes and analyze data for research. 

I graduated in 2020 with a BS, majoring in Physics and Astrophysics. Since then, I've been interested in all things programming. I have projects in Data Science (including ML), Web Dev, and Game Dev.

- Data Science is my focus with Python being my main language.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby-on-Rails and Javascript for Web Development and C# with Unity for Game Development.
